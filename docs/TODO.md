1. Create repository on GitHub and clone it locally.

2. Create a feature branch, add a file, commit, look at the staging area, push to origin. Observe your commit in GitHub commits and study commit graph in Insights/Network.

3. Make another commit, create a pull request and merge it into main. Create a tag for current version.

4. Discuss .gitignore.

5. Discuss conflicts.

6. Demonstrate a good workflow: create an issue -> feature branch -> work and commit often -> pull request -> merge -> close issue.

7. Create real programming task with several issues. Solve the issue in a topic branch, commit to the repository.
