# Problems

## Personal

1. Wrote a piece of code half a year ago, don't remember how it works anymore.
2. Code was working on one machine, doesn't work on a new computer.
3. Had a working version of code, then did a couple of "fixes". The code works no longer and don't remember how to return it to the working version.
4. Wrote useful functions, cannot import them in inother project. Carry around the same script in every folder.

## Collaboration

1. A colleague modified the code, it's not working anumore.
2. Found a very useful package. Cannot understand what happens there, how to install and modify it. Error after error.
